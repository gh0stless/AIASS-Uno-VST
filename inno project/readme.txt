Welcome to the SIDBlaster ASID protocol player for Windows.

You will of course need 1-3 SIDBlaster-USB and an additional program for a virtual MIDI cable.
I recommend loopMIDI by Tobias Erichsen:
https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html
Install this and set up a MIDI port.

Plug in your SIDBlaster and then start ASID Player and select this port.

Now go to:
https://deepsid.chordian.net/
Select ASID (MIDI) as the player and then select the same MIDI port.
Play a tune...
