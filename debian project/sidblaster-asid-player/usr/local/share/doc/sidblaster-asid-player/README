Welcome to the SIDBlaster ASID protocol player for Linux.

Plug in your SIDBlaster and then start ASID Player and select the MIDI loop port.

Many browsers today come as Flatpak or Snap and are configured in such a way that they cannot access MIDI devices. If you can't change that, your only option is normal Google Chrome.

Now go to:
https://deepsid.chordian.net/
Select ASID (MIDI) as the player and then select the same MIDI port.
Play a tune...
