With SIDBlasterTool you can check if library and device communication works.

Depending on your system, tunes with high data rates (multispeed tunes or digitunes) may 
play slower if the latency of the USB driver is too high. This can be remedied by setting
the driver write buffer size to a larger value, for instance:

export SIDBLASTERUSB_WRITEBUFFER_SIZE=8

Even down to 0, works on fast machines.
